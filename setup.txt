SETUP
======

$ ng new NgAdmin --routing -is -st -style=scss

With the command above, we are asking Angular CLI to create a new project with a routing module (--routing), 
use inline style (-is) for app.component.ts, skip the creation of unit testing files (-st) - since we will not need .spec file for this example and also use scss as extension for our style/CSS files.


$ ng g m auth --routing
